Day Mode Card is a simple, clean Home Assistant card that lets you manage two daily modes in one place:

- **Day mode** (e.g. Home, Work, Remote, Away)
- **Thermostat mode** (e.g. Off, Heating, Cooling, вентиляция)

It combines them into a single, easy-to-use view with a circular selector for the thermostat mode and a dropdown for the day mode.

## What you can do

- Switch thermostat modes quickly
- Turn the thermostat off with one tap
- Change the day profile without leaving the card
